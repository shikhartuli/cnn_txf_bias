# Vision Transformer



## Available models

We provide models pre-trained on imagenet21k for the following architectures:
ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/32 - more coming soon, watch out for changes to this
repo. We  provide the same models pre-trained on imagenet21k *and* fine-tuned on
imagenet2012.

## Implementation

Tests to conduct shape/texture bias extraction and fine-tuning can be found in [vit_jax_bias-tests.ipynb](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/blob/main/vision_transformer/vit_jax_bias-tests.ipynb) and [vit_jax_fine-tune.ipynb](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/blob/main/vision_transformer/vit_jax_fine-tune.ipynb)
