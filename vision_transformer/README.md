# Vision Transformer

The ViT models were used to run fine-tuning on CIFAR-10/Imagenet and to run experiments for extracting out shape/texture biases of indivisual models. These tests can be found at [vit_jax_bias-tests.ipynb](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/blob/main/vision_transformer/vit_jax_bias-tests.ipynb) and [vit_jax_fine-tune.ipynb](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/blob/main/vision_transformer/vit_jax_fine-tune.ipynb).

## Results

Results after running experiments on the fine-tuned model are available at [results/fine-tune](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/tree/main/vision_transformer/results/fine-tune). Fine-tuned models with different sets of augmentations are avaiable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18dZOi_wsmo9cxULgsASKjw1N6Iocvw4h?usp=sharing).
