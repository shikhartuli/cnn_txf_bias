## Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning

The BiT model was used to fine-tune pre-trained ResNet on the augmented CIFAR-10 dataset. JAX implementation on Google Colab can be found in [colabs/big_transfer_jax.ipynb](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/blob/main/big_transfer/colabs/big_transfer_jax.ipynb)
