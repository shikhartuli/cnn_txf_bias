# Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning

The BiT model was used to fine-tune pre-trained ResNet on the augmented CIFAR-10/Imagenet datasets. The code is from [google-research/big_transfer](https://github.com/google-research/big_transfer) repository. JAX implementation on Google Colab can be found in [colabs/big_transfer_jax.ipynb](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/blob/main/big_transfer/colabs/big_transfer_jax.ipynb). 

## Results

Results after running experiments on the fine-tuned model are available at [results/fine-tune](https://github.com/shikhartuli/cnn_txf_bias/tree/main/big_transfer/results/fine-tune).
